# Workout-Tracker
Workout Tracker iOS app that uses the SwiftUI framework
This was my senior project.

## Introduction
I chose this idea for my project because I am very passionate about
bodybuilding and the gym, I also am interested in mobile app development.

## Purpose
My app will accomplish tracking someone’s workout and save that data
to the phone and use that data to calculate 1-rep max’s.

## Scope 
My project will not provide workout routines or teach or provide
instruction on how to complete a certain exercise. My project will track
workouts and tell the user what their potential 1-rep max is.
Technologies Used: Swift, SwiftUI
